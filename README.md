# CIFAR-10-Object-Recognition-in-Images-for-beginners
CIFAR-10 Object Recognition (Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10)- for beginners. Score around 90%. <br>
There are two versions of the CIFAR-10 dataset: one from Kaggle and the other from Keras datasets. <br>
If you want to compete in the Kaggle competition, go to the Kaggle version of the notebook, if you only want to learn- the Keras version will fit better. <br>


These notebooks were written by Maor Vaknin and Itay Cohen, two Electrical Engineers with B.Sc degrees from the Technion University in Israel. <br>
We both learned Machine Learning and Deep Learning as part of our degree and this Kaggle competition was our first project outside of the university. <br>
